### AIM
To merge two Python dictionaries into one, ensuring all key-value pairs are combined. If there are duplicate keys, values from the second dictionary will overwrite those from the first.
---

### ALGORITHM

1.Start with the first dictionary (dict1).

2.Update dict1 with key-value pairs from dict2.

3.If a key is repeated, the value from dict2 will overwrite the one in dict1.

4.Return the merged dictionary.

---

### PROGRAM

```
dict1 = {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}
dict2 = {'Thirty': 30, 'Fourty': 40, 'Fifty': 50}

dict1.update(dict2)
print(dict1)
```

### RESULT
Thus the python program to merge two Python dictionaries into one, ensuring all key-value pairs are combined. If there are duplicate keys, values from the second dictionary will overwrite those from the first is executed successfully.
